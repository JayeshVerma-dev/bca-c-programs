# BCA C Programs — Semester 1

This repository contains all my C programming practice codes, lab work, assignments, and learning exercises from **BCA Semester 1**.  
The main purpose of this repo is to build consistency, improve logic-building skills, and maintain a clean coding portfolio for future interviews.

---

## 📌 What’s Inside
- All C language programs covered in Semester 1  
- Practice codes (loops, arrays, functions, strings, etc.)  
- College lab assignments  
- Extra logic-building programs  
- More programs will be added as the semester progresses

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository
- To learn GitHub properly from the first semester  
- To maintain an interview-ready coding profile  
- To track my programming improvement over time  
- To keep all my C language work organized in one place

## 🛠 How to Run the Programs

### 🔹 **1. Running With Turbo C++ (Old Method)**
If you are using Turbo C++:
1. Save the file with `.c` extension  
2. Open Turbo C++  
3. Open → the file  
4. **ALT + F9** — Compile  
5. **CTRL + F9** — Run  

> Note: Turbo C++ uses an old Borland compiler and is not recommended today.

---

### 🔹 **2. Running With GCC (Recommended — Modern Compilers)**

If you are using GCC (VSCode, Windows, Linux, macOS):

**Step 1: Compile**
gcc filename.c -o output

**Step 2: Run**

Windows:
output.exe

Linux/macOS:
./output

---

## ⚠️ Compatibility Notes
Turbo C++ uses some non-standard features like:

- `#include <conio.h>`
- `clrscr();`
- `getch();`

These **do not work** in modern GCC compilers.

If a program fails in GCC:
- Remove `conio.h`
- Remove or replace `clrscr()`  
- Remove or replace `getch()`

After that, most programs will run perfectly.

## 📈 Future Updates
This repository will keep growing as I learn more topics in my BCA course.  
Upcoming additions may include:
- More C programs from Units 3 & 4  
- Cleaned and optimized versions of old programs  
- Better organized folders (if required later)

---

## ✨ Notes
This repo is part of my journey to improve programming skills and maintain a strong GitHub presence from the first semester itself.

More updates coming soon!
